subtitle: Going from idea to prototype to production

Here's a post from my time at Cratejoy on the <a href="https://medium.com/building-cratejoy/bootstrapping-recommendations-ea8c7c98be3c" target="_blank">recommendations</a> project I worked on.

This project was a great learning experience because it allowed me to:
- championing the idea with key stakeholders
- finding a way to "small scale test" it without (_much_) code
- scoping out what an MVP could look like
- measuring results and coming up with a plan for building a production version

Most of that list isn't in a typical engineer's daily routine, at least in my experience.
